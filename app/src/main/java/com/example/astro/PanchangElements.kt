/**
 * The five limbs of the Panchang, solved from the ephemeris.
 *
 * Three things were wrong here before, and all three were visible to every user
 * on every screen:
 *
 *  1. Tithi and Nakshatra end times were the hardcoded strings
 *     "अगले दिन 04:15 AM तक" and "रात्रि 11:30 PM तक" — the same two lines every
 *     day, for every city, on the Panchang screen, the daily card AND the home
 *     screen widget. They are now solved by bisection.
 *  2. Karana was `(elongation / 6) % 11`, which cycles all eleven names evenly.
 *     The real sequence has seven movable Karanas repeating eight times between
 *     four fixed ones across the sixty half-tithis of a lunar month.
 *  3. The lunar month was the Gregorian month index — August came out as Kartika.
 *     It now comes from the Sun's sidereal sign at the new moon that began the month.
